    "# Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "As a beginner in Python you will likely know about data types such as `int`, `float`, `bool`, e.t.c.\n",
    "You will likely know about `list`, `string`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will cover a few more ways of structuring data including.\n",
    "- `tuple`: Similar to a list but *immutable.\n",
    "- `set`: An unordered collection of items with no duplicates.\n",
    "- `dict`: A collection of named items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the best way to define `tuple` and `set` is by caparison to a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### `tuple`\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is for all intents a immutable list.\n",
    "It can be indexed `my_tuple[2]` or sliced `my_tuple[:-3]` like a list.\n",
    "It can be iterated `for i in my_tuple:`, `for i, value in enumerate(my_tuple)` like a list.\n",
    "But it cannot be modified ~~`my_tuple[3] = 5`~~.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are a commonly produced by functions that look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(x):\n",
    "    # Docstring...\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Some code that produces multiple things\n",
    "    a = x\n",
    "    b = x**2\n",
    "    c = x**3\n",
    "\n",
    "    return a, b, c\n",
    "\n",
    "func_return = my_func(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above if run would assign func_return the tuple (2, 4, 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>This is valid python but breaks a 'function rule' (more on that in the next notebook) making the function explicitly return a tuple would be much better.</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply change the return line to `return (a, b, c)` and the tuple becomes explicit.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple in your code is incredibly simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, \"hi\", False)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are great for avoiding accidental mutability, if you know you wont modify the content use a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `set`\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is more restrictive than a list but has different restrictions to a tuple.\n",
    "A set cannot be indexed or sliced. A set can be added to or removed from. A set can be iterated.\n",
    "If you have ever encountered the situation where you are asking the following you probably wanted a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What elements of this list are in (or not in) this other list?\n",
    "- What elements are in both of these lists?\n",
    "- What elements are in one but not both of these lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets have `builtin` methods for all of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `dict` or dictionary is one of the the most useful data structures in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dict is a collection of `key: value` pairs. Here is an example `dict`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A dict containing the characteristics of a pet dog\n",
    "my_dict = {\n",
    "'Name': 'Milo',\n",
    "'Owner': 'Cassandra'\n",
    "'Age' : 4,\n",
    "'Sex': 'Dog',\n",
    "'Breed': 'Mixed',\n",
    "'Parents': ('Poppy', 'Max')\n",
    "'Offspring': None\n",
    "'Tricks' : ['Sit', 'Paw', 'Beg', 'Stay'],\n",
    "'Color': 'Brown',\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then access members of this dict using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict['Name']\n",
    "\n",
    "```"
