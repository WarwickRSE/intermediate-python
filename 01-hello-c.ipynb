    "# The (very) basics of C, and how it relates to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference implementation of Python is built on C. Many of the high performant libraries e.g. Numpy are coded in C. Furthermore, fundamentally there are several patterns that appear in the fringes of Python that are easier to understand if you have a grasp of the basic pattens of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to avoid future issues and problems that can arise from making a duck typed, interpreted, and IMO 'loose language' your only touchstone for programming, we are going to dive into some very basic C. Some of this C will be directly relevant to Python and some will be designed to deepen your conceptual understanding of how computers work.\n",
    "\n",
    "C is a good touchstone, but if you have an understanding of any language that requires manual memory management you will get most of the benefits to understanding that should be conveyed by the following."

    "\n",
    "This is an incredibly simple script that will teach us little more than how to lay out C. \n",
    "The first line, the `#include <stdio.h>` is the `standard` `input` `output` library.\n",
    "This is directing the compiler to include the functions, variables, types, and constants that are in the `stdio` library. \n",
    "This library will be stored on your computed and the compiler will know, or be told, where to find it.\n",
    "We need it here to be able to access the `printf` function that we use to output the string to the command line.\n",

    "The `main` function is the code entrypoint, when the code is run it starts here. \n",
    "Preceding main is `int` or the functions return type, this will mean that on success the function will return 0. Returning an integer is standard behavior and is used to do error handling.\n",
    "The `return 0;` is where the main function exits and returns 0 to signal success. Anything other than 0 is assumed to be an error of some kind.\n",
    "Another common pattern is the `void` return type, where the function does not return.\n",
    "The function content is defined within `curly braces`. Unlike in Python the indentation does not matter, but we maintain it for readability.\n",
    "The final line of code `printf(\"Hello World!\");` is largely self explanatory.\n",
    "The last notable feature here is the semicolon `;` that you may have noticed on the end of each line. This terminates the expression. In Python the terminating character is newline, but C will ignore newlines and spaces altogether.\n",

    "\n",
    "The actual data stored (\"hello world\") is largely irrelevant here; both of these items are there to let the compiler 'reserve the correct chunk of memory'.\n",
    "Each `char` is one byte, which is 8 bits (A bit can be 0 or 1). There are 11 characters in the string we want to store, plus we need one null character ('\\0') which is sort of an invisible full stop for the computer (it tells the computer the text has ended and to stop reading).\n",
    "The `[12]` is thus required to inform the compiler to reserve 12 lots of 8 bits, or 96 bits total.\n",
