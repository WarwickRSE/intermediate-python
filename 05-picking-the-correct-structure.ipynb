    "# A very important aside\n",

    "\n",
    "W3 Schools:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a plainly worded index of most of the useful bits of the main language.\n",
    "They often stop short of getting into the real technical detail.\n",
    "If you just need to copy paste some code to get started before experimenting this is a good place\n",

    "PyPi:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving away from the language spec, PyPi is a place to look for packages.\n",
    "Search for the package here then you can use the project links to go to the package documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For very popular packages Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch, e.t.c ... this documentation is likely of high quality.\n",
    "Smaller or niche packages it will be down the the maintainer(s) or the community, so your milage may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Much less reliable but far more broad and far far (some times too far) more deep is StackOverflow:\n",

    "\n",
    "Think about the processes your code will do - this may put it into one of the following catagories:\n",

    "##### A pipeline or process\n",
    "\n",
    "Input -> A -> B -> C -> Result\n",
    "\n",
    "A, B, and C are ordered, there are intermediate data products, and the data is at the core of what the code does.\n",
    "Firstly [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a good starting point.\n",
    "It's likely that this code can be quite linear and tidy.\n",
    "One option is, as Pandas, is to create an object for your data and use methods to modify the object. \n",
    "Another is to have data streams loading files processing files and writing new files, this creates intermediate data products but is useful for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some almost Python, code that has no substance but shows the general structure, using pandas:\n",
    "\n",

    "##### A collection of utility calculations that use similar data or processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a package and you should look up how to write a package. (Let us know if this is a course you would like written)\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly you will need to identify what are the basic operations you will use repeatedly.\n",
    "If they are implemented by another package you have a 'dependency', if not, write the low level stuff yourself and then use these small parts in your other functions.\n",
    "Your other functions and potentially custom data objects/types should then be created to make sure the user (usually yourself in a few months time) cannot make mistakes from undefined behavior.\n",
    "You then need to make documentation available so users (usually you) can look up what your code can and cannot do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "##### A simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A simulation is similar to both of the above. \n",
    "\n",
    "There will be some state or initial condition, then some processes, then some output. \n",
    "However you don't know how often these processes will run or sometimes in which order so its not neat and linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likely you will write some kind of loop over steps or time, in this loop the data/state will undergo processes that are defined by it's current value. \n",
    "You will need to write code to define this data/object/state and code that contains the functions that act on the data/object/state.\n",
    "There may be different types of data/object/state - think about simulating an atom: you would need electrons, neutrons, and protons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a hard code task: start simple, test lots, and be ready to scrap and rewrite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some `almost Python` for this kind of code.\n",

    "            element.update()\n",
    "        if other_process(element.other_attribute):\n",
    "            element.other_process()\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### An event loop/process monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are coding to manage a process then you need some kind of monitor that waits for input or stimulus.\n",
    "On receiving stimulus, it will run a process based on this input, and respond or record appropriately.\n",
    "It then goes back to monitoring or waiting for the next input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of this is a Motion Detection light:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some `almost Python` for this kind of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "\n",
    "while PoweredOn:\n",
    "    person detected = check_for_person()\n",
    "    if person_detected:\n",
    "        switch_on()\n",
    "        while person_detected:\n",
    "            person detected = check_for_person()\n",
    "            wait(10)\n",
    "        switch_off()\n",
    "    wait(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concluding Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality you will likely use a blend of the above, or something more formalized if required.\n",
    "Just remember to not keep adding bits in a way that goes against the design. \n",
    "The code is likely to be rewritten many times, either in its entirety or aspects of it.\n",
    "Focus on modularity and clarity, making sure that each process is contained and can be isolated, to make this process of iterative development easier."
