    "- Functions improve code readability and can substantially shorten code by reducing code replication.\n",

    "<summary>*function guidelines</summary>\n",
    "0. Functions have a sensible name and a full docstring\n",

    "4. No side effects\n",

    "You may be thinking about how you can use the pointer like behavior to make a function do so so much more."
