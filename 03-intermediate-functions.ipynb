    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is going to deepen your understanding of functions, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refresher on why we use functions\n",
    "- Args and Kwargs and how to use them\n",
    "- Functions as a python object\n",
    "- Function Wrappers and decorators\n",
    "Advanced:\n",
    "- Just in Time compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refresher\n",
    "If you have followed [zero-to-python](https://moodle.warwick.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=55824) or other beginner python courses you will be aware that: \n",
    "- Functions improve code readability and can substantially shorten code by reducing code replication.\n",
    "- Functions are flexible but sticking to a few *guidelines will prevent them making your code more confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>*function guidelines</summary>\n",
    "0. Functions have a sensible name and a full docstring\n",
    "1. Return a single variable/object\n",
    "2. Have a single exit point\n",
    "3. Functions return or mutate, never both\n",
    "4. No side effects\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these are unfamiliar to you I suggest reading the [Functions Rules](https://github.com/WarwickRSE/training-zero-to-python/blob/main/03-Functions.ipynb) section of zero-to-python.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, if these guidelines make more sense now you've seen some of the awkward pointer-like things that python can do. \n",
    "You may be thinking about functions which you expected to have no side effects but inadvertently mutated their inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Args and Kwargs\n",
    "\n",
    "Args and Kwargs are shorthand, **Arg**ument**s** and **K**ey **w**ord **arg**ument**s**. Looking at an example function:\n",

    "\n",
    "The `key word arguments` are `d`, `e`, and `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All `arguments` must come before `key word arguments`.\n",

    "All `arguments` must be provided `key word arguments` can be omitted and will take their default value.\n",
