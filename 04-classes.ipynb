    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are a major part of Python and object oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes have a set data structure, which confers benefits when you have definite processes you want to run on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many examples and uses of classes we will start with the concept of giving structure to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into that, lets look at how to create a class, based on the dog which we previously stored in a dictionary lets see how that changes when we use a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A refresher on the dictionary we used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {\n",
    "'Name': 'Milo',\n",
    "'Owner': 'Cassandra'\n",
    "'Age' : 4,\n",
    "'Sex': 'Dog',\n",
    "'Breed': 'Mixed',\n",
    "'Parents': ('Poppy', 'Max'),\n",
    "'Offspring': None,\n",
    "'Tricks' : ['Sit', 'Paw', 'Beg', 'Stay'],\n",
    "'Color': 'Brown',\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build this up bit by bit until we have a data structure that at least matches the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce concepts and expect you to work in one script iteratively improving the Dog class in [learning_classes.py](../../../edit/Intermediate%20Python/intermediate-python/python-scripts/learning_classes.py). \n",
    "Similarly to other notebooks code cells will then import that class and pass it to another function which will provide feedback by testing the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Like `def` for functions, `class` is a keyword for classes.\n",
    "class Dog:  # Usually class names are capitalized.\n",
    "    # The `__init__` method is the constructor.\n",
    "    # It is called when an instance of the class is created.\n",
    "    # The first argument is always `self`.\n",
    "    # `self` refers to the instance of the class.\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):  # After `self`, you can add other arguments like a normal function.\n",
    "        self.name = name # For simple attributes, you can just assign them to `self` like so.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an instance of a class, you call the class like a function, passing in any arguments.\n",
    "An attributes of an instance of a class are acessed using `.`, so here `my_dog_class.name` is the `name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You don't pass in `self` when creating an instance (or when calling any method).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "my_dog_class = Dog(\"Milo\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Open the [learning_classes.py](../../../edit/Intermediate%20Python/intermediate-python/python-scripts/learning_classes.py) script and write the Dog class. Include in the constructor the following items from the dictionary: `Name`, `Owner`, `Age`, `Sex`, and `Color`.\n",
